title: Duo Modifiers
---

Duo-modifier is an idea combined with [home row mods](https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods)
and [duo-layer](/rules/duo-layer):

- Map one single key to mod(s) will be similar to either [layer](/rules/layer)
  or [simlayer](/rules/simlayer), which would have the same problems.
- Duo-modifier uses 2 keys instead, similar to [duo-layer](/rules/duo-layer).
- It also has [the same problems as duo-layer](/rules/duo-layer#problems-in-duo-layer).

:::tip
When get started, it can be very useful to show a notification when the mod(s)
are activated.
